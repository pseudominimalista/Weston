# My [Weston's](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wayland/weston) configurations files and instalation script.  

# Things to know:  
- The script `instalar.sh` (which stands for install.sh, I speak portuguese) is intended to be used on a basic  
instalation of [EndeavourOS](https://endeavouros.com/) (it is the "No Desktop" option on the instaler), I didn't test it on  
a pure Arch install, maybe it will work fine, you'll only need Yay installed for the script to work properly.  
- The script installs **A LOT** of things, so feel free to remove some parts to suit your needs.  
- All of the keybinds are the standard Weston's keybindings (I don't have an idea of how to change them)  
- As I said on the first point, I speak portuguese, so maybe (probably) you'll find some comments of the files writen in portuguese.  
Sorry about that, but it is what it is and i'm not gonna change it that soon.
- Weston is a **UNUSABLE** Compositor with a pretty face, unless you only need a few apps, I recommend you use Sway instead of it,  
[here's my Sway repo if you are interested](https://github.com/pseudominimalista/Sway)  
- Yes, it has a emacs config. Yes, it's probably broken. Sorry, i'll try to fix it if that's the case.
